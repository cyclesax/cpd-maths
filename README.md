Dan and Rob are talking about how universities and actuarial people use Python.

We don't know much about Python but we know rather a lot more about programming and maths using other languages.

We are exploring the key features of Python in a very straightforward way with some small samples of code.

We don't expect that you will find this very interesting, but if you do then that's great.
